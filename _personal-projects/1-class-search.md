The Notre Dame Class Search Tool is designed for Notre Dame students to track class sections from Notre Dame's [Class Search](https://classsearch.nd.edu/) website. Developed using Python and Selenium, it enables users to manage class sections, including adding, removing, and viewing them. The tool also keeps a record of these sections and updates this information as needed.

For user convenience, the tool supports automated updates, which can be configured on Unix-based systems using Cron and on Windows-based systems with Task Scheduler. This functionality ensures students are regularly informed about the status of classes they are interested in.

The source code for this project is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/johnflanagan827/class-search).
