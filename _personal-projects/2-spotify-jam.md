Spotify Group Jam is a web application developed over the summer, utilizing Django and React for its construction. It features a mobile-first design, ensuring the user interface is optimized for phone screens, yet remains visually appealing and functional on desktop devices.

The primary functionality of Spotify Group Jam involves hosting group listening sessions. In these sessions, a designated host has control over the music. The host can pause, play, skip, search for, queue, and play different songs for the group.

The source code for Spotify Group Jam is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/johnflanagan827/spotify-group-jam).
