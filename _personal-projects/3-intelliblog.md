IntelliBlog is a web application I developed that uses artificial intelligence to craft blog posts from custom prompts, YouTube URLs, and other uploaded media. It utilizes the GPT API for text generation and Stability AIâ€™s Stable Diffusion for AI-driven image creation. These features make IntelliBlog a versatile tool, ideal for bloggers and content creators seeking to enhance their posts with AI-generated content and images. The inclusion of OAUTH authentication further ensures a secure and user-friendly experience.

The application's user interface is designed for simplicity and efficiency, offering a clean and intuitive layout. This design facilitates easy navigation and use of IntelliBlog's advanced AI functionalities. Integrating these AI capabilities smoothly into the blogging workflow, the platform efficiently assists users in generating unique blog content and accompanying images.

Technically, IntelliBlog is built on a robust and scalable infrastructure. The backend leverages Next.js for its core functionalities, while the frontend is developed using React and Tailwind CSS for a responsive and aesthetically pleasing user experience. MongoDB is employed for effective data management, and NextAuth.js is integrated for secure user authentication. 

For those looking to set up IntelliBlog, the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/johnflanagan827/intelliblog) provides concise and clear instructions in the README.
