I developed Space Race in C as the final project for Notre Dame's Fundamentals of Computing (CSE 20311). This single-player arcade game employs the gfx graphics library and an X11 display server. It presents players with the task of piloting a spaceship through a field of moving asteroids while avoiding collisions. The game features a scoring system, start and end screens, and a timer to enhance the gaming experience.
