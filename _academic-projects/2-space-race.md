I created Space Race in C as a final project for Fundamentals of Computing (CSE 20311) at the University of Notre Dame. This single-player arcade game utilizes the gfx graphics library and an X11 display server. It challenges players to navigate a spaceship through moving asteroids, avoiding collisions. The controls are simple: 'W' to move up, 'S' to move down, and 'Q' to quit. The game includes a scoring system, start and end screens, and a timer for an engaging gameplay experience.
