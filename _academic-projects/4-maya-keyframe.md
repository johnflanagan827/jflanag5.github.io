These low-poly animations were created in Autodesk Maya 2024 for Notre Dame's [Technical Concepts of Visual Effects](https://vfx.cse.nd.edu/vfx/) course (CSE 40655).

# Maya Low-Poly Car Animation

This animation features a low-poly urban city with cars navigating through it. The project includes keyframe animation for the main car and path constraints for background vehicles.
