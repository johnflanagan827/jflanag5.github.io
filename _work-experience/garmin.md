During my internship at [Garmin](http://www.garmin.com), I contributed significantly to developing a progressive web app focused on parcel delivery management. This app streamlined operations by automating email reminders, providing real-time package tracking, and simplifying package pickups through a user-friendly interface. A highlight of this experience was presenting the app to stakeholders, including parcel store associates, and incorporating their feedback to optimize usability and functionality.

On the technical side, I led the design and implementation of a reliable backend API using Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, and Redis. This backend system efficiently managed package logistics, user authentication, and communication functionalities like email notifications, ensuring smooth and reliable operations. Concurrently, I designed a responsive Vue.js frontend interface that allowed seamless interaction, offering features such as package status updates, delivery scheduling, and notifications for employee pickups.

Moreover, this internship provided valuable insights into the digitalization of manufacturing processes. It showcased how software solutions can automate tasks, enhance efficiency, and improve accuracy in operational workflows, contributing to a more streamlined and productive environment.
