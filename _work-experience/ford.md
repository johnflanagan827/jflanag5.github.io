At [Ford](https://www.ford.com), I was part of the Ford Credit team, working remotely. As a full-stack software engineer, I contributed to the development of the Dealer Information System (DIS) online application, using Angular for the frontend and Springboot for the backend. 

My duties included improving mobile responsiveness, addressing security vulnerabilities, and designing workflows for creating and deleting various loan types, with a focus on functionality and user experience. I also helped in facilitating deployment processes. 

During this internship, I applied Agile methodologies and test-driven development practices to support efficient software development processes.
